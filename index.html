                    <p>Situated remotely off the coast of Port Douglas, the Agincourt reef is a collection of small “ribbon reefs”. The Agincourt offers numerous potential dive sites with a blend of channels and gardens for marine explorers to navigate. Luckily, this reef is visited by multiple tour operators showcasing the Outer Reef’s beauty.  <a href="https://greatbarrierreef.com.au/which-reef-is-best/">***</a></p>

                        <p>Fitzroy Island is easily accessed from Cairns and sits roughly 29km offshore of Tropical North QLD’s famous adventure hub. An actual, granite island as opposed to a coral cay, Fitzroy Island possesses largely different characteristics to several of the other popular islands in the region; it’s quite mountainous; it’s covered in rainforest; and as a result it thus offers a lot of on-island activities in which to participate in addition to its obvious reef offerings.   <a href="https://greatbarrierreef.com.au/which-reef-is-best/">***</a></p>

                        <p>Renowned for its excellent visibility and balanced mix of dive opportunities, the reef blends together a series of excellent wall dives and swimthroughs with a number of deep canyons for experienced divers and shallows for novices; as a result, there’s “something for everyone” here for those making the trek out.  <a href="https://greatbarrierreef.com.au/which-reef-is-best/">***</a></p>

                    <h3>Properly cycle the tank</h3>
                        <p>While you might think you’re going to be able to fill a lovely glass bowl with water out of the tap and plop your new fish right into it, it’s definitely not recommended. Fill your tank with gravel, add your filter, then add water. Allow time for beneficial bacteria to populate the gravel and the filter. Use a tank starter if time does not permit. Then set your tank to maintain the proper temperature and pH for the species of fish kept and add appropriate lighting.</p>

                    <h3>Acclimate</h3>
                    <p>Make sure your fish are conditioned to the water you’ll be using and the water temperature before adding them to the tank. This can be done by floating them in bags or gradually adding tank water to the bag. It should only take about 15 minutes to an hour to do this.</p>

                    <h3>Ensure plenty of elbow room</h3>
                    <p>Don’t over crowd your finned family members! Make sure there is no more than (roughly) 1 inch of fish per gallon of tank size. The best bet is to purchase the biggest tank your budget and your space allows. That way, you’ll have room to grow your collection if you decide that fish keeping is your thing (which it totally will be, for sure).</p>
